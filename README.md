## Blackmate

Blackmate is a generator for the tools list of BlackArch Linux OS, made originally the XFCE4 Desktop. The script fetches the latest tools and generates a new entry on the start menu.
I wanted to have a Blackarch Setup running on KDE which was not possible with the original Script so i improved it a bit. Its now running on all major Desktops including KDE Plasma.

## still to go
- Fixing Folder Icons

```
git clone https://github.com/byReqz/blackmate

cd /usr/share/blackmate
sh blackmate.sh
```
